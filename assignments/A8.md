# ðŸ¥· **Haskell Dojo Assignment 8: Monads**

>Source file: `src/HM/A8.hs`

### **Q#01**:
  * Write refactored versions of the `validateNoDict` and `validateWithDict` functions we defined in **Assignment 6-2**, using (`>>=`) to compose the component validators (instead of manually case-matching/destructuring and propagating exceptions).

### **Q#02**:
  * Write an action `playGame` that takes a ***Game*** value and returns a unit value in the ***IO*** context.
  * This is the most complex piece of program logic, so read the following instructions carefully!
  * Using `do` notation, implement the following logic:
    1. Call the `promptGuess` action from the provided code.
    2. Use the `getUpperChar` action to get a move from the user and bind the result to a variable.
    3. Call `_SPACE_`.
    4. Apply `processTurn` and pattern-match on the result using a `case` expression. You'll need to write 3 different case patterns to handle the following possibilities:
      a. **The game is over:** in this case, print the game-over message (you defined this in the ***Show*** instance for the ***GameException*** type), then print a message informing the player what the correct word was. *Hint:* remember which adapter we can use to sequence two monadic actions when we don't need the result of the first action.
      b. **Any other exception occurred:** print the exception and call `playGame` recursively with the same ***Game*** value. We're creating a looped action that will repeat until the player enters a valid move or the game ends.
      c. **An updated *Game* value was returned:** in this case, the player has entered a valid move, and the game's "state" has advanced. Print the new **Game** value, then check whether the ***Guess*** field is equal to the ***Secret*** field. If so, print a message saying that the game has been won. Otherwise, call `playGame` recursively, applying it to the updated **Game** value.
        * *Hint:* remember when using conditional expressions like `case` or `if`/`then`/`else` inside a `do` block, we need to create a nested `do` block if we want to continue writing code in `do` notation!

### **Q#03:**
  * Write an action `startGame`, which takes a validator function (:: ***Secret*** -> ***Either GameException Secret***) as input and returns a unit value in the **IO** context.
  * This action should do 2 things:
    1. Receive a secret word from the player using the `setSecret` action, and bind the result to a variable.
    2. Apply the validator function (argument) to the ***Secret*** value supplied by the player above (this produces a value of type ***Either GameException Secret***); then apply `makeGameIfValid` to this result, and with a `case` expression, match on the two possible values this returns:
      a. **An exception occurred:** the ***Secret*** value is invalid; print the exception, then call `startGame` recursively, applied to the same validator argument.
      b. **A *Game* value was returned:** print the ***Game*** value, then apply `playGame` to it to start the gameplay.

### **Q#04:**
  * The `runHM` action is essentially the `main` action for our Hangman application.
  * Replace the placeholder `putStrLn` action in `runApp` with an action that does the following:
    1. Call the `getDict` action you defined in Assignment 7 and bind its ***Maybe Dictionary*** result to a variable.
    2. Use a `case` expression to pattern-match on the result, defining patterns for the `Just` and `Nothing` possibilities.
      * If a **Dictionary** is found, partially-apply the `validateWithDict` validator to it, and pass the resulting function as an argument to `startGame`.
      * If no dictionary is found:
        * Print the following message: `"Missing dictionary file! Continue without dictionary? [Y/N]"`.
        * Then call the `getUpperChar` action you defined in Assignment 7, binding the result to a variable.
        * If the result is `Y`, apply `startGame` to the `validateNoDict` validator. We can use `if`-`then`-`else` for this, but there is monadic helper function lets us more easily perform an action conditionally like this, and returns a unit value inside the context when the predicate is `False`. Review the slides for Lesson 5 if you don't remember.
  * Your Hangman game should now be fully functional! Try running `cabal run` in the terminal to play (if you're inside a GHCi session, exit using `:q` to return to the regular terminal).
